title: Overview
---

The team is currently working on setting up two technology stacks for the backend [Strapi](https://strapi.io/) & [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/).

Think of it like this Strapi is the private API. FastAPI as the public API.  FastAPI is the only one that talks to Strapi. The coding will be on FastAPI, the storage will be on Strapi. If strapi offers a plugin for that then it is less coding for us.

## Objective

- [ ] Setup the technology
- [ ] Setup the contribution repository for each technology.
- [ ] Each project lead will be providing a 1 hour tutorial / warm up on the technology for the rest of the team members.
- [ ] Each team member will be working directory with the project lead and co-presenting the tutorial.
- [ ] Mentors will provide support and guidance.

## Strapi (Nodejs)

Strapi is a Headless CMS and provides an API. Also it comes with a collection of plug-ins that will make our lives easier.

## FastAPI (Python)

FastAPI is where the coding will happen. It the API/End point that we will expose and share. It will be doing the heavy lifting when it comes to processing the data in between, do any augmentation modifications. In short what strapi can't do or does not have a plugin for.
