FastAPI as the public API. FastAPI is the only one that talks to Strapi. The coding will be on FastAPI, the storage will be on Strapi. If strapi offers a plugin for that then it is less coding for us.\nObjective Setup the technology Setup the contribution repository for each technology. Each project lead will be providing a 1 hour tutorial / warm up on the technology for the rest of the team members. Each team member will be working directory with the project lead and co-presenting the tutorial. Mentors will provide support and guidance. Strapi (Nodejs) Strapi is a Headless CMS and provides an API. Also it comes with a collection of plug-ins that will make our lives easier.\nStatus Setup Strapi Mentor Majed Al-Chatti Project Lead Zayed Al Raeesi Members Maryam Almansoori, TBA FastAPI (Python) FastAPI is where the coding will happen. It the API/End point that we will expose and share. It will be doing the heavy lifting when it comes to processing the data in between, do any augmentation modifications.
